          1.What is an access token and refresh token? How do they work and
          where should we store them on the client-side?
        </h2>
        <p className="Question-one">
          Access Token: An access token is a credential that is used to access
          protected resources on behalf of a user or an application. It is
          typically a string of characters that represents the authorization
          granted to a user after a successful authentication process. Access
          tokens are time-limited and contain information such as the user's
          identity, permissions, and expiration time. When making requests to an
          API or a server, the access token is included in the request headers
          to authenticate and authorize the user. Remember to use secure
          communication channels (e.g., HTTPS) when transmitting tokens between
          the client and server to prevent interception or tampering.
          Additionally, regularly rotate and invalidate refresh tokens to
          mitigate the potential impact of token leaks or unauthorized access.
          Refresh Token: A refresh token is a credential that is used to obtain
          a new access token when the current access token expires. It is
          usually issued alongside the access token during the initial
          authentication process. Refresh tokens have a longer expiration time
          compared to access tokens, and they are securely stored by the
          client-side application. The typical flow for using access and refresh
          tokens is as follows: Authentication: When a user logs in or
          authorizes an application, the server validates the credentials and,
          upon successful authentication, generates an access token and a
          refresh token. Access Token Usage: The client application includes the
          access token in the request headers when accessing protected resources
          from the server or API. The server verifies the access token to ensure
          that the request is authorized. If the access token is valid and not
          expired, the server processes the request and returns the requested
          data. Access Token Expiration: Access tokens have a limited lifespan,
          typically a short duration, to minimize the impact of unauthorized
          access if a token is compromised. When an access token expires, the
          client application needs to obtain a new one.

        <h2 className="text-2xl"> 2.Compare SQL and NoSQL databases?</h2>

        <p className="Question-two ">
          SQL and NoSQL are two distinct types of databases that differ in their
          data models, query languages, scalability, and use cases. Here's a
          comparison between SQL and NoSQL databases: Data Model: SQL: SQL
          databases use a structured data model based on tables with predefined
          schemas. Data is organized into rows and columns, and relationships
          between tables are established using foreign keys. NoSQL: NoSQL
          databases employ various data models, such as key-value, document,
          columnar, and graph. They offer more flexible schemas and allow for
          storing unstructured and semi-structured data. Query Language: SQL:
          SQL databases use Structured Query Language (SQL) for defining and
          manipulating data. SQL provides a standardized way to perform
          operations like querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data. It
          supports complex joins, aggregations, and powerful querying
          capabilities. NoSQL: NoSQL databases typically have their own query
          languages or APIs. The query languages for NoSQL databases are often
          simpler and focused on specific data models. Examples include
          MongoDB's query language, Cassandra Query Language (CQL), or key-based
          operations in Redis.

          3.What is express js? What is Nest Js?
        </h2>

        <p>
          Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js. It
          provides a minimalistic and flexible set of features to build web
          applications and APIs. Express.js simplifies the process of handling
          HTTP requests, defining routes, managing middleware, and integrating
          with various templating engines or libraries. Key features of
          Express.js include: Routing: Express.js allows you to define routes
          for different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and URL
          patterns. It provides a simple and intuitive API for handling incoming
          requests and generating responses. Middleware: Express.js uses
          middleware functions that can be chained together to handle requests
          and perform tasks such as logging, parsing request bodies,
          authentication, error handling, and more. Middleware functions have
          access to the request and response objects, enabling customization and
          extension of the application's behavior. Templating: While Express.js
          itself does not include a specific templating engine, it provides
          support for integrating popular templating engines like EJS, Pug
          (formerly Jade), Handlebars, and others. Templating engines allow you
          to generate dynamic HTML or other response formats. Nest.js, on the
          other hand, is a progressive and opinionated framework for building
          efficient and scalable server-side applications with TypeScript.
          Nest.js is built on top of Express.js, enhancing it with additional
          features and architectural patterns inspired by Angular. Key features
          of Nest.js include: Modularity: Nest.js promotes a modular approach to
          building applications. It emphasizes the use of modules to organize
          and encapsulate components, routes, services, and middleware. Modules
          allow for better code organization, reusability, and maintainability.
          Dependency Injection: Nest.js leverages TypeScript decorators and
          dependency injection (DI) to manage and inject dependencies into
          application components. DI simplifies unit testing and enables better
          separation of concerns. Decorators and Metadata: Nest.js makes
          extensive use of decorators and metadata to define and configure
          application components, routes, middleware, and more. This approach
          allows for a declarative and intuitive programming style.

          4.What is MongoDB aggregate and how does it work ?
        </h2>
        <p>
          In MongoDB, the aggregate function is a powerful tool used to perform
          advanced data aggregation operations on collections. It allows you to
          process and transform data, perform calculations, apply filters, group
          documents, and more. The aggregate operation uses a pipeline-based
          approach, where multiple stages are applied sequentially to the data.
          The basic structure of an aggregation pipeline consists of one or more
          stages, each performing a specific operation on the data. Here are
          some commonly used stages in the aggregate pipeline: $match: Filters
          the documents based on specified criteria, similar to the find
          operation. It allows you to select a subset of documents to include in
          the aggregation pipeline. $group: Groups documents together based on a
          specified key or keys and applies aggregations within each group.
          Aggregation functions like $sum, $avg, $min, $max, and $first can be
          used to calculate aggregate values. $project: Reshapes the documents
          by including, excluding, or transforming fields. It allows you to
          define the desired output structure of the documents in the pipeline.
          $sort: Sorts the documents based on specified fields and sort orders.
          It is typically used to order the results before further processing.
          $limit and $skip: Limits the number of documents or skips a specified
          number of documents in the pipeline output. These stages are useful
          for pagination or controlling the result set size. $unwind:
          Deconstructs an array field into multiple documents, creating a new
          document for each element in the array. It is helpful when you need to
          work with individual array elements during the aggregation. These are
          just a few examples of the available stages in MongoDB's aggregation
          framework. You can combine and chain multiple stages to create complex
          aggregation pipelines that meet your specific data processing
          requirements. Aggregation pipelines in MongoDB are executed in the
          database server, providing efficient processing and leveraging indexes
          when applicable. The pipeline stages are applied in the order
          specified, and the output of one stage becomes the input for the next
          stage. Here's an example of using the aggregate function in MongoDB to
          find the average age of people in a collection:
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
